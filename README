NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::RTorrentStatus - A PoCo-IRC plugin which
    prints RTorrent status messages to IRC

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::RTorrentStatus;

     # post status updates to #foobar
     $irc->plugin_add(Torrent => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::RTorrentStatus->new(
         Torrent_log => '/tmp/torrentlog',
         Channels    => ['#foobar'],
     ));

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::RTorrentStatus is a POE::Component::IRC
    plugin. It reads a log file generated by the included irctor-queue
    program and posts messages to IRC describing the events. See the
    documentation for irctor-queue on how to set it up with RTorrent.

METHODS
  "new"
    Takes the following arguments:

    'Torrent_log', the path to the torrent log file generated by the
    irctor-queue program. This argument is required.

    'Channels', an array reference of channels to post messages to. You must
    specify at least one channel.

    'Color', whether to print colorful status messages. True by default.

    'Method', how you want messages to be delivered. Valid options are
    'notice' (the default) and 'privmsg'.

    Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to POE::Component::IRC's
    "plugin_add" method.

TODO
    Handle RTorrent restarts. Currently the torrent name will be replaced
    with the torrent hash after a restart.

    Handle Magnet links. RTorrent doesn't support them yet, but when it
    does, there won't be a torrent file laying around for us to look up.
